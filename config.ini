CONTENT = I have a database called db.db with the following structure:

    Client table with fields: dni, name, surname
    Address table with fields: dni, street, code
    PostalCode table with fields: code, province, city

    The relationships between tables are:
    Client and Address: dni
    Address and PostalCode: code

    The database engine is SQLite. I want the SQL script.
